## CEPL 

CEPL is very cool project by baggers.

https://github.com/cbaggers/cepl

I was having trouble getting the example to run.

https://github.com/cbaggers/cepl.examples


I'm not sure if I just don't understand packages enough but I had to edit an example, adding package some qualifications, to get it to work.
So I thought i'd share what I used to get CEPL running in case someone else wants to try CEPL but is having trouble.
